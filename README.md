This is my customized KDE Plasma setup, blending the elegance of macOS aesthetics, GNOME-inspired colors, and a touch of Windows to create the perfect balance of beauty and usability in Plasma desktop.

The colors are designed to match both Qt and GTK apps, ensuring a consistent experience. I use several apps like Foliate, and with this setup, I can use both Qt and GTK apps without feeling annoyed by mismatched aesthetics.

I recommend enabling the KDE Rounded Effects desktop effect if you're not using fractional scaling (100% or 200%). I personally avoid it due to the blurriness that happens with fractional scaling, likely caused by KWin.
